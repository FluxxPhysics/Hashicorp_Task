# What is the difference between push, pull, and fetch?

The purpose of this page is to familiarize you with push, pull and fetch Git commands.  

Below are brief descriptions of each command:

* 'Git push' - updated changes from a local branch that are sent (pushed) to a remote repository
* 'Git pull' - updated changes from a remote branch that are pulled into your tracking branch and merged
into a local branch
* 'Git fetch' - updated changes sent from a remote repository into your tracking branch

## How these commands work

'Git push' and 'git pull' are often described as equals. This isn't entirely correct. A 'git pull'
executes two branch commands: pull and merge. From your branch, a 'git push' checks for a tracking branch 
connected to a remote repository. The code is then shared, so both branches reflect the same changes. 

When there is a disconnection between branches or the commits are inconsistent, synchronize the remote 
branch. You can do this with 'git pull', or by performing 'git fetch' followed by 'git merge'. No changes 
are made to your branch until you perform 'git merge origin/master'. This allows you to better understand and 
confirm changes before merging.
